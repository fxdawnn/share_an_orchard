# share_an_orchard

This was a project that focused on creating community resilience by building fruits fruit-sharing network. The project ended up remaining in a repository for maybe some part of training for a broader coding efficiency framework for the future.

There were a few names adopted for the project -- fruit4all. This project is an exploration that how building a mobile app could benefit broader food security.
